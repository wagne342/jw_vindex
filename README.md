# jw_vindex
A max external for estimating resonant models.

This is a work-in-progress that demonstrates the basic signal-flow and process of producing near-realtime resonant model estimates from a specified window of a signal buffer in max.  Currently, the basic functionality is demonstrated.  See the included test patches for explanation of basic functions.

TODO: 
* Implement Decay Rate Estimation
* Fix crash on FFT window resizing.
